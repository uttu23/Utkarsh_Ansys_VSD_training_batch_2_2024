**chip components**

1. Pads: Through which we can send the signal inside the chip.
2. Core: Place where all the logic gates are fixed.
3. Die: Present at the corner. it is the size of the entire chip.

**RTL to GDS flow**

- RTL -> Synthesis -> Floor planning and Power planning -> Placement -> Clock Tree Synthesis -> Route -> Sign Off

- Floorplanning -> Dimensions, Pin locations and rows are defined
- Placement -> Placing cells on floor planned rows. It is done in two steps 1) Global (not legal placement) 2) Detailed routing
- CTS -> To deliver a clock to all seq elements with minimum skew
